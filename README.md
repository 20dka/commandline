# commandline
A C++ commandline for use in servers and chat software. Provides very simple asynchronous input/output.

Supports reading and writing at the same time, using VT100 ANSI escape codes. This means that, on windows, you need to enable those for your CMD terminal.

For an example, read `main.cpp`.
